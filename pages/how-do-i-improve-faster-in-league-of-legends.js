                                        you can destroy all your enemies on your own without the need of any teammate. We would recommend you to <b>practice and 
                                        {<Link style={{display : 'inline-block'}} href="/"><a style={{display : 'inline-block'}}> buy a lol smurf</a></Link>} in order to practice as much as you can your mechanics without losing any of yours lps in ranked</b>,
