                                    <h2>Jungle</h2>
                                    <h3>Ekko</h3>
                                    <p> Ekko is one of the best champions to carry in low elo, playing Ekko has basically no weaknesses. 
                                        He has <b>strong ganks </b>because of his <b>high mobility</b> and he's got <b>great jungle clear</b>, 
                                        .But one of the best things about Ekko is his <b>burst damage</b>, so you can kill enemy champions in seconds with your combo. 
                                        Ah, and he's a really really <b>slippery</b> champion too.

                                    </p>

                                    <p>Ekko is an <b>amazing champion to look for ganks.</b> You start with Timewinder, 
                                       which applies a nice bit amount of damage and also slows your enemy. This synergies well with Parallel Convergence,
                                       and Phase Dive which.
                                       Keep in mind that  Ekko has his <b>Chronobreaking</b> so <b>even if you mess up you can just rewind</b>.
                                       </p>

                                    <p> When looking for ganks, <b>it’s useful to pair Ekko with champions that can assist him with additional CC</b>,
                                        as the slow from Timewinder it is not usually enough to guarantee kills.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Kha’Zix</h3>
                                    <p> If you like hunting your enemies, then Kha’Zix is your champion for smurf your enemies in solo queue.
                                        He is undoubtedly a strong jungler, and <b>his true power lies in his ability to walk around the map killing champions</b> 
                                        out of position or casually farming in lane alone.

                                    </p>

                                    <p> When you reach <b>level six, you can turn invisible </b> improving the odds you sneak up on opponents when 
                                        looking for ganks. Try to make sure your allies don’t make it look obvious that you’re 
                                        around. <b>You also have some crowd control's tools</b> to slow opponents with the Voidreaver’s 
                                        Unseen Threat passive, plus the long-range Void Spike attack. You can also <b>jump into targets </b>if they are 
                                        trying to run away from you.
                                       </p>

                                    <p> This champion <b>is a playmaker </b>, Kha’Zix is an ideal pick for the solo queue where everything is a completely mess.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Zed</h3>
                                    <p> Zed is a champion whose sole purpose is to assassinate his enemies so if like to roam and snowball games 
                                        he is your champion! Zed has a <b>decent laning phase</b>, and he can farm minions quite safely using Razor Shuriken and Shadow Slash
                                        he can but once you reach <b>level 6 you can start to obliterate soft 
                                        targets on the opposing team and snowball the game</b>.

                                    </p>

                                    <p> Your skill<b>,Death Mark, is gonna be a really powerful tool to use to kill weak opponents</b>,
                                        that will allow you to set up some high burst damage. Plus, his passive, Contempt for the Weak,
                                         will help you a lot by finishing off weakened targets.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Kassadin</h3>
                                    <p> Kassadin is an <b>hyper-carry for the mid lane as he brings a lot of damage and anti-mage power </b>that 
                                        gives him an advantage over others magic damage dealers.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>  <b>His passive </b>is really important as it <b>reduces all the magic damage taken by 15%</b>.
                                         With his skill,<b>Null Sphere, can interrupt channels while gaining a magic damage shield.</b>
                                         One key ability is <b>Force Pulse ability, that you need to charge up with spell casts.</b> Once it is fully
                                         charged the spell is unlock and you can <b>deal a lot of damage</b> to the champions that are in front of you. 
                                       </p>

                                    <p> But it is <b>his mobility what makes Kassadin a real threat as the game progresses,</b> the more dangerous he becomes
                                        as his ultimate cooldown is reduced.So <b>he can teleport in a short distance </b>closing the gap or creating space between 
                                        you and your enemies. 
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Kai’Sa</h3>
                                    <p> She is a <b> very versatile and adaptable</b> champion with a kit that grants 
                                        her a lot of power as a damage dealer. She can be either AP or AD so she is a safe pick in many team 
                                        compositions too, ensuring she will fit in many compositions that other adcs wouldn't.
                                    </p>

                                    <p> <b>Kai’Sa can inflic some serious damage with skills </b>such as Icathian Rain, whose targeting is random so
                                         you'll need to be smart when you use it, and make sure you're
                                        not missing enemies or minions because remember, farming is really important in League of Legends.
                                       </p>

                                    <p> <b>Upgrading Supercharge </b>is pretty important since this ability is gonna grant you some elusiveness in team
                                         fights because you are gonna be one of the targets they are gonna focus on. The <b>brief invisibility </b>is not 
                                        incredibly powerful, but that <b>will buy you some time to reposition yourself in those team fights</b>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        So,Kai'Sa is a all-rounder adc who does a lot of <b>hybrid damage</b> and <b>have some tools to protect herself like her ultimate 
                                        </b>that you can use to reposition yourself in team fights.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Lucian</h3>
                                    <p> Lucian is a really powerfull Marksman who <b>excels in the laning phase</b> and if played properly
                                        will become a serious threat in during the mid and late game. Lucian is a solid pick for solo queue because
                                         he <b>doesn’t have any bad matchup.</b>
                                    </p>

                                    <p> You have to notice that mostly all Marksmen champions are weaker at the start of a match,
                                        but not Lucian so you should take advantage
                                        of this <b>strong early game </b>and poke your oponents as much as possible during the early stages making sure you
                                        end the lanning phase with an advantage. As a tip use his passive to gain a small edge over your opponents.
                                        So <b>combine his abilities with a free double auto-attack </b>and you will find yourself
                                        ahead in trades against your lane opponents.

                                    <p> As a difference from other adcs, <b>Lucian can be a bruiser or a glass cannon</b> like a Caitlyn.
