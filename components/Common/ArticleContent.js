            <h2 className="margin-top-h2">What is a League of Legends smurf account?</h2>

            <p>It is pretty simple, but don't worry! You are not alone, there are a lot of people who don't know what a smurf is. 
               Well, it is pretty simple, a smurf is simply an <b>unranked lvl 30 account  where people start playing in order to practice
               new champions or just for playing in a competitive environment for fun without taking the risk of losing their lps in
               their main account if they are playing bad that particular day.</b></p>


               <p>If you are searching for the highest quality and the least expensive League of Legends smurf accounts then you are in the right place, because there isn't any better site for buying smurf accounts than LolSmurf.
                For those of you who don't have any idea of what a League of Legends smurf account is, let us help you out with it. When you create a fresh new account on LOL
                it begins at level 1 and this confines the number of summoner spells, champions, runes, dominances
                  and game modes accessible which it pretty frustrating</p>

                <p>The great news is  that as you play League of legends and start gaining some levels, you'll gradually unlock new runes and summoner spells. The bad news is this process can
                take quite a while. When you finally get level 30 you'll unlock the feature to play ranked games in lol. Ranked games are the place the
                enjoyment in League of Legends starts. By playing ranked matches with your teammates, you face different players that will turn you into your best form. </p>
                
                <p>So, if you want to have fun at this game you need a lol lvl 30 account to play ranked games. Since it can
                require some investment to climb your League of Legends account to level 30 , we've thought of a quicker way. For less than $1 a level, you can buy a level 30 LoL account which is already
                prepared to play in ranked games. This implies you can just buy your smurf account, sign in and you can start having fun playing rankeds without going through
                months of playing to level up your account.</p>
                
                <p>As you can see, with the amount of time you have saved by buying a League of Legends account, it's pretty obvious to see why to buy a lvl 30 lol account is so popular. This has led to 
                an explosion in the Smurf market, with a lot of different LoL smurf account sellers out there. Unfortunately, there are a lot of websites that don't care
